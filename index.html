            <!-- Yes, I coppied this from wikipedia, this is me siting my sources https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_lamp-->
            <p>A safety lamp is any of several types of lamp that provides illumination in coal mines and is designed to
                operate in air that may contain coal dust or gases, both of which are potentially flammable or
                explosive. Until the development of effective electric lamps in the early 1900s, miners used flame lamps
                to provide illumination. Open flame lamps could ignite flammable gases which collected in mines, causing
                explosions; safety lamps were developed to enclose the flame and prevent it from igniting the
                surrounding atmosphere. Flame safety lamps have been replaced in mining with sealed explosion-proof
                electric lights.</p>
